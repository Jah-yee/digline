"""`run_exit_code`: the first round's exit code, as one function. (#318)

The rule was written inline twice, behind `digline report` and `digline
explain`. Written from the mistake each test prevents: the first round
answering `1`, which needs a relation it does not have; a cause of `2` that
the first round misses; and the restricted rule drifting from `exit_code`,
which is the rule it restricts.
