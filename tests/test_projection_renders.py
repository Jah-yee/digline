"""A projected document, rendered: the report names nothing and still reads.

A served page shows projected documents (ADR 0038), so both renderers meet
documents whose names are tokens. Nothing measured that before. These tests
are what a served projection is worth: if a renderer broke on a token, or
printed a name the projection had removed, a way to project the run under
review would buy nothing. (ADR 0038 §1, §2)
