"""`compare()` refuses a pair whose `projected` differs. (Delta-pass over
0.25.0, F-1)

A projected document names its cases by token, and a document in clear names
them by text. Paired across the two, no case meets its counterpart: each one
reads as `new` plus `missing`, which exits 0. So a regression compared against
the projected reference disappeared, and the headline said nothing got worse:
fixed decision 3's vacuous green, reached through pairing. The refusal sits
beside the tenant's, for the same reason: the arithmetic is valid and the
reading is nonsense.

**What this does not close.** Two projections minted from different tables
fail the same way, and both declare `projected`. Nothing in a projected
document says which table minted it, so nothing here can tell them apart.
That is ADR 0036's question, and it is open: the last test below is held as
an expected failure, so that it turns red the day it is answered.
