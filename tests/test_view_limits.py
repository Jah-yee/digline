"""`digline view` bounds what one connection can cost it: the body it reads, and
the time it waits.

`do_POST` read `Content-Length` and then read that many bytes with no ceiling,
and `ThreadingHTTPServer` gave every connection a thread with no timeout. So a
caller that declared a large body, or sent half a request and went quiet, held
a thread for as long as it liked, and every such caller was one more.

**Each test asserts what the server decided, not that the connection ended.** A
connection ends for many reasons: the test client's own timeout, a handler that
raised, the server shutting down. So a refusal is read as its status and its
sentence. The one refusal with no response to read, a timeout while the headers
are still arriving, which the stdlib handles by closing, is read off the
server's own `log_error` and the time it took.

In-process rather than through `digline view` in a subprocess, because the
timeout under test is thirty seconds and a test has to be able to shorten it.
The handler class, the route and the checks are the ones `serve()` uses.
