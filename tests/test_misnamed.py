"""A verdict carries its assertion's name, or it is refused. (ADR 0027 §6,
amended 2026-09-28)

`Score.name` crosses verbatim into a redacted document, so a name an assertion
built from the answer carries the answer out past the redaction of the reason
beside it (ADR 0034 §7, route 4). The driver compares every raw verdict's name
with the name the assertion declared before the first case, and refuses the
mismatch: one errored verdict, marked `misnamed`, and not the whole case.

**Every test that says "refused" asserts the marker, not the status.** An
errored status is what an assertion that raised produces too, and telling the
two apart in a redacted document — where the reason is gone — is the whole
reason the marker exists. A test that asserted `status == "error"` would pass
on a verdict that errored for any other reason.
