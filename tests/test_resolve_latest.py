"""`latest` when the newest run is gone (#286).

A scan sees what is there, not what was. So the note can name a missing run
only where a committed artifact remembers one newer than the pick — the
baseline, or a register line — and must stay empty otherwise. The first two
tests are the controls that were red before the note existed. The third keeps
the note from being said on every resolution, which would pass the first two
and tell nobody anything. The fourth pins the case no store can see, so that
widening the note is a decision somebody takes, not a drift.
