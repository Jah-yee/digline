"""The readers take `ResultStore`, and this file is what holds them to it.

Retyping a signature from `FileResultStore` to `ResultStore` binds almost
nothing on its own: every construction site passes a `FileResultStore`, which
satisfies both. The retyped sites hold one another only where one calls
another — `_resolve` holds `resolve_key`, `explained` holds `read_run`, `serve`
holds `ViewHandler` — and only for as long as the caller stays retyped. Measured
before this file existed, reverting one site at a time: those three went red,
and the other six stayed green. What makes each one hold is a caller passing
something that is **not** a `FileResultStore` — `MemoryStore`, which implements
the five and nothing else — so that pyright's strict run over `tests/` goes red
on the argument the moment a parameter narrows again. Each of the nine was
reverted in turn with this file present, and each went red here.

**It holds exactly the sites called below, and each is named with how:**

| Site | Held by |
|---|---|
| `host.resolve_key`, `read_run`, `need_baseline` | a call that runs |
| `host.explained` | a call that runs |
| `cli.main._resolve` | a call that runs |
| `cli.main._resume` (`SupportsJournal`) | a call that runs, with `_NoJournals` |
| `cli.view.ViewHandler` | a server that runs and serves a page from the fake |
| `cli.view.serve` | **a call pyright checks and nothing runs** |
| `pytest_digline.plugin._measure` | **a call pyright checks and nothing runs** |

The last two are called in `held_by_pyright_alone`, which nothing calls: `serve`
blocks until interrupted, and `_measure` needs a target to call. pyright reads
the calls and the interpreter never does, so the signature is held and the
body is not exercised through the fake. The body is held by the annotation
itself — inside a function whose parameter says `ResultStore`, a call to a
method the protocol lacks is already a type error — and that half needs no
test.

A new signature typed `ResultStore` is held by none of this until a test here
calls it with the fake. That is the whole reach of the file.
