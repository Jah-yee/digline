"""A verdict without an `assertion_id` is refused, by a name that says so.

It used to default to the score's name. `Score.name` is never empty, so after
construction no verdict could lack one, and the fallback fired only where a
verdict was *built* with `""`. That happens on two routes: a document carrying
`""`, which the reader then read by deriving the identity ADR 0001 says must be
refused; and an assertion that did not pass one, which the driver then recorded
as an unreconciled gap instead of naming the cause. On a projected document the
first route copied a verdict name's token into `assertion_id`, a field that
crosses in clear, and the §8 check let it through. (#263, check 4)
