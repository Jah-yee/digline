"""A run that is missing from the scan, and what `log` may say about it (#287).

A scan sees what is there, not what was. A missing run folded away in silence.
Its neighbours joined into one span, a roll it carried disappeared, and a first
sighting moved to the next run read. The reading therefore asserted things
that did not happen.

What the fold can see is what #286 found for `latest`: the two committed
artifacts that record a run's `created_at`, the baseline and the register.
Every case below that names the missing run in one of them was red before the
fold read them. The last two are the other half:
- a store where every run named is read says nothing;
- a missing run that neither artifact names **still folds away**, which is the
  limit this repair does not lift.
